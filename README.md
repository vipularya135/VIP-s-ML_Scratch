# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various supervised machine learning algorithms from scratch and their counterparts using the scikit-learn library. The goal is to provide a learning resource and a practical comparison of the performance of custom implementations versus the well-established scikit-learn implementations.

## Project Structure

- `/Algorithms-Scratch`: Custom implementations of machine learning algorithms.
- `/datasets`: Sample datasets used for testing and training.
